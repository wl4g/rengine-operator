# Rengine Operator

The kubernetes operator of [rengine](https://github.com/wl4g/rengine)

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [K3S](https://k3s.io/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Preparing

- 1. Installing kubebuilder

```bash
sudo curl -L -o /bin/kubebuilder 'https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/download/v3.9.1/kubebuilder_linux_amd64'
sudo chmod +x /bin/kubebuilder
sudo ln -snf /bin/kubebuilder /bin/kb
```

- 2. Installing certmanager

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.6.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

### Running on the cluster

- 1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

- 2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=docker.io/wl4g/rengine-operator:latest
```

- 3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=docker.io/wl4g/rengine-operator:latest

kubectl -n rengine-operator-system get po
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rengine-operator-controller-manager-7567b4fbd9-ngpzp   2/2     Running   0          64s
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Extension module for examples

```bash
# Add api
kb create api --group rengine --version v1beta1 --kind RengineController
# Add webhook
kb create webhook --group rengine --version v1beta1 --kind RengineController \
--defaulting --programmatic-validation
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

- 1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

- 2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

### FAQ

- 1. If you run make docker-build and report an error that gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot cannot be pulled, you can use the mainland backup image. Note: If you want to make a backup image yourself, you may only be able to pull it in GCP's cloud-shell or VM (because authentication is required on overseas VMs of other cloud vendors)

```bash
docker pull registry.cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/wl4g-k8s/distroless_static:nonroot
docker tag registry.cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/wl4g-k8s/distroless_static:nonroot gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot
```
